## About the Project

This is a group project Hangman game called "WannaHang@SIT" developed in Python with a graphical user interface (GUI). The initiative is designed to support freshmen students enrolled in the ICT IS/SE programs during their first trimester at SIT. This interactive quiz platform offers a fun and accessible way for students to gauge their readiness for their upcoming final exams.

The main objective of this project is to help new students familiarize themselves with the level of academic rigour they will encounter during their first exam week. The game features questions covering key topics from the modules students take in their first trimester. By engaging with these quizzes, students can assess their strengths and identify areas for improvement, ensuring they are better prepared for their exams.

This approach not only helps reduce exam-related stress but also fosters a sense of community and encourages healthy academic competition among SITizens.
